# My Vim configuration #

I copied liberally from Steve Losh's suggestions in ["Coming Home To
Vim"](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/), complementing
things with bits and pieces from Vincent Driessen's ["How I boosted my
Vim"](http://nvie.com/posts/how-i-boosted-my-vim/) and random stuff found in
various formidable [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org).

Most of the plugins I heavily use were created by the amazing [Tim
Pope](https://github.com/tpope).
